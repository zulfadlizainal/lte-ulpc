# 4G-LTE-UL-Power-Control
Simulating power control algorithm for UL in LTE based on 3GPP TS36.213 and available extended features. This scope includes UL power control algorithm for PRACH, PUCCH, and PUSCH.

## 1. PRACH Power Control ([Link](https://github.com/zulfadlizainal/4G-LTE-UL-Power-Control/tree/master/PRACH%20Power%20Control))

This simulation is derived from 3GPP TS36.321 PRACH Power Control algorithm. In addition to that, the PUSCH TX power for MSG3 can also be estimated based on the result refering to TS36.213.

## 2. PUCCH Power Control

In Progress.

## 3. PUSCH Power Control ([Link](https://github.com/zulfadlizainal/4G-LTE-UL-Power-Control/tree/master/PUSCH%20Power%20Control))

This simulation is derived from 3GPP TS36.213 PUSCH Power Control algorithm (which is based on P0). In addition to that, the PUSCH TX power effect is also being studied when UL SINR is taken into account in PUSCH TX power adjustment algorithm.
